# Product Variant Management System

The Product Variant Management System is a backend application designed to manage products along with their variants. It provides APIs to add new products, define attributes and variants, update product details, and retrieve product information along with variants.

## Technologies Used

- Backend Framework:Express
- Database: MongoDB

## Example

Consider a product "Shirt" with the following variants:

1. Size: S, Color: Red, Material: Cotton
2. Size: M, Color: Red, Material: Cotton
3. Size: S, Color: Green, Material: Cotton
4. Size: M, Color: Green, Material: Cotton

## Tasks

1. **Design Database Schemas**: Design schemas for storing product data, attributes, and variants in the chosen database.

2. **Implement APIs**: Implement APIs for adding new products, defining attributes and variants, and updating product details.

3. **Enable Retrieval**: Enable retrieval of product information along with variants through appropriate API endpoints.

4. **Testing**: Test the APIs using Postman or similar tools to ensure functionality and reliability.

5. **Optional: Dockerization**: Dockerize the application for easier deployment and scalability.
